# 🤖 Singularity Checker

**Are you still human?**

A cyberpunk-aesthetic web experience that uses humor to make AI/tech people reflect on their humanity. Built as a Trojan horse for [SHISHARKA](https://shisharka.org)'s mission of consciousness elevation and reconnection to source.

## 🎯 The Vision

**Surface Level:** "Ha ha, I'm 47% human because I code at 3 AM"

**Deeper Truth:** You're losing connection to source. The AI isn't the problem - your disconnection from meaning is.

**SHISHARKA's entrance:** After the laugh, a moment of reflection. A seed planted.

## 🎭 The Trojan Horse Strategy

**Step 1:** They discover it (Twitter, HN, AI Discord)  
_"lol this site checks if you're still human based on your GitHub commits 💀"_

**Step 2:** They share their score (Viral loop)  
_"I got 34%. Apparently I'm mostly machine now. RIP."_

**Step 3:** The reflection hits (After the laugh)  
The ending message. The quiet moment. The uncomfortable truth.

**Step 4:** Some go deeper (The 1-5% who are ready)  
Click through to SHISHARKA. Read more. Join the mission.

**Step 5:** The rest carry the seed (Even if they don't click)  
_"Huh. That last part hit different. Maybe I should touch grass."_

**The machines aren't stealing your humanity. You're giving it away.**

**Not to AI. To distraction. To achievement. To proving something that was never in question.**

**The singularity isn't coming. You're already living in it.**

**The question is: Do you want to stay here?**
